# Metaballs with Shaders

This is my implementation of metaballs, inspired by [this Coding Train video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccYLb7cLB1I). I use fragment shaders to render the metaballs, since Processing enable you to write your own shader. Compared to the one I tried written pure Processing, the speed difference is tremendous. See [this video](https://youtu.be/LZfmCuEPRIM) for the demo.
